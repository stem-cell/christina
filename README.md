## Christina

This is a code package to improve the MyImoutoBooru software on hypnohub.net.
It evolved from a smaller script, and now groups several facilities, which
will be managed as a single unit.

The name comes from a [Steins;Gate reference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-GqSWsISVs).

## Roadmap

I'll quote the wise Linus Torvalds on this one:

> Don't hurry your code. Make sure it works well and is well designed. Don't worry about timing.

## Requirements

Besides from the basic requirements to be running MyImoutoBooru, make sure you have the MySQL Native Drivers. If you do, you would see a section like this in your PHPInfo:
